# Introduction

> Scroll down for code samples, example requests and responses. Select a language for code samples from the tabs above or the mobile navigation menu.


TODO: Introduction

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication


TODO: Authentication

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
